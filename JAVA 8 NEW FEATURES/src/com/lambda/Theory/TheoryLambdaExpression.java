// If lambda expression contains multiple parameters, then these parameters are separated with comma(,)
// A lambda Expression can have any number of argument including zero number
// Lambda Expression body can contain multiple statements and we should enclose within curly braces
// If lambda expression contains only one argument then parentheses are optional

// The main objective of lambda expression is to enable FUnctional programming in JAVA
// Lambda Expression concept applicable  for all languages	, but very unfortunate it comes late in JAVA
// With lambda expression we can write very concise code so that readability of the application will be improved. 
// Functional interface reference can be used to hold lambda expressions
