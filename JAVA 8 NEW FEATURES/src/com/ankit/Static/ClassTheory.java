//  Class vs interface
	
// 1.)Class	
// class is costly because it contains constructor	
// class is heavy weight component
// instance method is always associated with object 	
	
// 2.)	interface	
// interface never contains constructor , it never contains static block, never contains instance block
// there fore it is not costly, It is light weight component
// we never going to create an object in interface


// static method is no way related to object
// if you have only static method then don't go for class, it's better to go for interface
// from 1.8 version onwards interface support static methods also because static methods is nowhere related to object.
// then no need to go for class	

// interface static method you can call only by using interface name only there is no other way to call interface static method
